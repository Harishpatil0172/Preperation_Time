# Text Ecoding:

### 1.What is text encoding and why is it important in computer science?

Text encoding is the process of converting characters into a digital format for storage and transmission. It is important in computer science because it allows computers to represent and manipulate text data in a standardized way.
Without text encoding, computers would not be able to understand the characters we type and display on our screens. Each character would need to be represented by a unique binary code, which would be inefficient and difficult to manage.
Text encoding schemes provide a mapping between characters and binary codes. This mapping allows computers to store and transmit text data in a compact and efficient manner. It also enables different systems and applications to exchange text data seamlessly.
For example, the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding scheme assigns a unique 7-bit binary code to each of the 128 characters in the English alphabet, as well as some common symbols and control characters. This encoding scheme is widely used for representing text in English-language documents and applications.
Unicode is another popular text encoding scheme that supports a much wider range of characters, including those from non-English languages and scripts. Unicode uses a variable-length encoding scheme, which means that each character can be represented by one or more bytes. This allows Unicode to support a vast number of characters, making it suitable for representing text in multilingual environments.
Text encoding is also important for data security. By using appropriate encoding schemes, sensitive data can be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.
Overall, text encoding is a fundamental aspect of computer science that enables the storage, transmission, and manipulation of text data in a standardized and efficient manner.

### 2.Explain the difference between ASCII and Unicode.
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a 7-bit character encoding scheme that assigns a unique 7-bit binary code to each of the 128 characters in the English alphabet, as well as some common symbols and control characters. ASCII was developed in the 1960s and is widely used for representing text in English-language documents and applications.
Unicode is a multi-byte character encoding scheme that supports a much wider range of characters, including those from non-English languages and scripts. Unicode uses a variable-length encoding scheme, which means that each character can be represented by one or more bytes. This allows Unicode to support a vast number of characters, making it suitable for representing text in multilingual environments.


* Key differences between ASCII and Unicode:


* Number of characters: ASCII supports 128 characters, while Unicode supports over 1 million characters.
* Character set: ASCII includes only English characters and some common symbols, while Unicode includes characters from a wide range of languages and scripts.
* Encoding scheme: ASCII uses a fixed-length 7-bit encoding scheme, while Unicode uses a variable-length encoding scheme.
* Compatibility: ASCII is widely supported by older systems and applications, while Unicode is more widely supported by modern systems and applications.
* Advantages of Unicode over ASCII:
* Wider character support: Unicode supports a much wider range of characters, including those from non-English languages and scripts.
* Internationalization: Unicode is essential for representing text in multilingual environments.
* Future-proof: Unicode is designed to support new characters and scripts as they are developed.

* When to use ASCII:

When representing text in English-language documents and applications that are compatible with older systems.
When file size is a concern and the text does not contain non-English characters.

* When to use Unicode:

When representing text in multilingual environments.
When working with text that contains non-English characters.
When future-proofing your applications and data.
